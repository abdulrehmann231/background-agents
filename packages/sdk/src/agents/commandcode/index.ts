/**
 * Command Code CLI Agent Definition
 *
 * Command Code (commandcode.ai) is a Claude-Code-shaped CLI: `-p` runs
 * headless, `--output-format json` streams NDJSON event frames, `-m <model>`
 * picks the model and `--resume <id>` continues a session.
 *
 * Auth is a single Command Code API key. The CLI reads COMMAND_CODE_API_KEY
 * from the environment and prefers it over ~/.commandcode/auth.json, so
 * injecting the env var is all the sandbox needs — no login flow, no config
 * file. Print mode refuses to start without it (exit 3), and that gate applies
 * even to BYOK providers, which is why every Command Code model in
 * `agentModels` requires this one key rather than the user's Anthropic/OpenAI
 * key. Models route through the user's own plan; ids are the catalog's exact
 * ids (`claude-sonnet-5`, `deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash`, …).
 *
 * Skills and MCP need no per-run wiring here: Command Code discovers
 * user-level skills from ~/.agents/skills, which is exactly where
 * @background-agents/sandbox-skills installs them, and reads MCP servers from
 * ~/.commandcode/mcp.json, which @background-agents/agent-configuration writes
 * before the session starts.
