/**
 * Daily credit refill.
 *
 * Once per UTC day, raises every balance below its plan's target in
 * {@link DAILY_CREDIT_TARGET_USD} to exactly that, and leaves everything at or
 * above it alone. The grant is the shortfall, so a free user at $0.10 gets
 * $0.15 and one at $0 gets $0.25. Negative balances are refilled in full — see
 * the constant for what that costs us and why it was chosen anyway.
 *
 * `unlimited` is skipped entirely: it is ungated and never spends credits, so
 * it has no target and nothing to refill.
 *
 * One statement, not a loop over users. Production caps the Prisma pool at one
 * connection per instance, so several hundred sequential transactions would
 * monopolise it for the duration; and the whole point of the operation is that
 * it either applies to a user today or does not, which a single data-modifying
 * CTE expresses directly. Same shape as migration
 * 20260905120000_backfill_signup_credits, for the same reasons.
 *
 * Exactly-once per user per UTC day rests on `CreditTransaction.externalId`
 * being uniquely indexed: the `NOT EXISTS` skips anyone already refilled, and if
 * two runs race past it the index aborts the statement — which rolls the balance
 * write back with it, because both halves are one statement. Setting a level
 * rather than adding to one is a second line of defence: even an applied
 * duplicate would land on the same balance.
 *
 * No catch-up for a missed day. A refill to a fixed level has nothing to catch
 * up on — the next run puts the user exactly where the missed one would have.

/**
 * Per-plan targets in micro-dollars, resolved once at module load.
 *
 * Null means "not refilled" and binds as SQL NULL, which drops the row at the
 * `before < target` comparison — that is how `unlimited` is excluded. Derived
 * from the constant rather than written as a literal `NULL` in the query, so
 * giving a plan a target later is still a one-line change there.
