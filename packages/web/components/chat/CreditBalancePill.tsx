 * would be most misleading (a turn finished by the lifecycle cron with no
 * stream attached, the daily refill, a top-up in another tab).
 *
 * Always the real number, for every signed-in user, whatever they happen to be
 * running in the chat — including at zero and below, which is exactly when it
 * matters most.
 *
 * `creditsMode` only decides whether a low balance is *worth warning about*:
 * an uncapped plan or an account on its own keys can sit at $0.00 all day
 * without being blocked, so colouring that red would be a false alarm. The
 * figure still shows; only the alarm is conditional.
