 * the composer. A banner that reappears on every page load is noise a user
 * learns to click past, and one that never reappears is a warning they see once
 * and forget, so the rules below try to fire exactly when there is something new
 * to say.
 *
 * Deliberately free of React and of `localStorage` itself: the decision is a
 * pure function of (tier, balance, stored record, now), which is what makes the
 * cooldown testable without faking a clock inside a component.

 *  2. **The cooldown elapsed.** See {@link DISMISS_COOLDOWN_MS}.

 *     into a warning tier is genuinely new; a user who tops up and burns through
 *     it in an hour should hear about it.
 *  4. **The balance halved.** $0.09 → $0.04 is materially worse than what they
