/**
 * Shared credential pool resolution (server-only).
 *
 * Three agents can run against a server-provided "shared" credential when the
 * user hasn't stored their own key/token: Claude Code (rotating OAuth pool),
 * Gemini and OpenCode (server env keys). Everything else always uses the user's
 * own key. This module centralizes:
 *   - which agents have a shared pool,
 *   - the internal provider id used as the TokenUsage.provider / tokscale client,
 *   - resolving whether a given run is "shared" vs "user" for metering & limits.
 *
 * It also defines the small `metadata.usage` blob stamped on the assistant
 * message at send time so the turn finalizer (which runs later, in the cron)
 * can attribute the run without re-deriving credentials.
