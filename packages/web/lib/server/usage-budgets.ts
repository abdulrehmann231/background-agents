/**
 * The daily spending balance for the shared credential pools.
 *
 * One balance, spent across every shared pool. It is denominated in US dollars of
 * published API list value — the same figure the ledger already stores in
 * `TokenUsage.costUsd`, priced from Anthropic's rates for Claude (see
 * lib/server/claude-pricing) and from tokscale for everything else.
 *
 * It is deliberately NOT a dollar anyone paid: Claude runs on a flat Max 20x
 * subscription, so the number is notional value, exactly as the admin dashboard
 * labels it. Keeping the meter denominated in list value means the only question
 * it has to answer is "what would these tokens have cost", which has a checkable
 * answer.
 *
 * Why one pooled allowance instead of a budget per provider:
 *   - Three budgets in three units (USD, USD, messages) gave three different
 *     answers to "how much do I have left", and a user who exhausted one could
 *     simply move to another. One number is both honest and unroutable-around.
 *   - Claude is ~98% of the draw, so pooling costs almost nothing. Replayed over
 *     1,194 user-days (Jun–Sep 2026) the pooled rule allowed $7,150 against
 *     $7,185 under the old per-provider rules — a $35 difference, and exactly
 *     one additional capped user-day.
 *
 * Free models are excluded entirely (see isFreeModel), so a user with nothing
 * left can still work on OpenCode's free tier. That is the intended floor.
 *
 * Enforcement is post-hoc: a turn's cost is only knowable once it has run, so
 * spending is checked before the NEXT turn. One turn can therefore overshoot —
 * see lib/db/usage-limit.

/**
 * Free-tier daily balance, in USD of API list value.
 *
 * Sized from the ledger, not modelled. Over 77 active days (Jun–Aug 2026): 106
 * users, 6,463 shared turns, $14,846 of value — ~$193/day at ~11.9 users active
 * per day, averaging $2.30 a turn. Note a "turn" here is a whole agentic run
 * (many API round-trips, each re-reading cache), not a single call, which is why
 * it costs orders of magnitude more than a chat message.
 *
 * Cost per user-day was distributed:  p50 $8.37 · p75 $17.26 · p90 $42.55 ·
 * max $237.39. The tail is the problem this cap exists to solve — 8 of those 106
 * users accounted for 75% of all spend, and left alone they crowd everyone else
 * out as the pool grows.
 *
 * The 100k-token cap this ultimately replaces was worth a median of $8.10 of
 * real value per user-day — but anywhere from $4.80 (p25) to $26.78 (p90),
 * because the same token allowance buys wildly different amounts depending on
 * the model. That spread is why a token cap never controlled the pool: we were
 * hitting the subscription's weekly limit (77 times in that window, plus 57
 * Fable-specific and 26 session limits) while the cap looked like it was holding.
 *
 * $5/day sits below that $8.10 median, so it is a genuine tightening.
 *
 * Two things this does NOT bound:
 *   - The `unlimited` plan, uncapped by definition. It accounted for $44/day of
 *     the historical draw, and no value here touches it.
 *   - The pool as a whole. This caps a single user; 200 users active at once is
 *     still 200× the balance. A pool-wide daily ceiling is the only hard bound,
 *     and it does not exist yet.
