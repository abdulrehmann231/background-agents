 * treated identically, and there is no separate free daily tier to fall back
 * on, so this is always about credits.
 *
 * Deliberately names no provider: the balance is pooled, so "your Claude limit"
 * was both wrong and confusing once the same allowance covered Gemini and
 * OpenCode. Free models are called out because they genuinely still work — they
 * never draw down the balance — and that is the most useful thing a blocked user
 * can be told.
 *
 * Topping up leads the list of next steps now that it exists: it is the only
 * one the user can act on immediately and alone. Adding an API key means
 * having one.
